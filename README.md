* To generate Fig. 1, run python3 figure_1.py. Requirements: numpy, matplotlib. Running time is about a minute on CPU due to the fine discretization of sphere.

* To generate Fig. 2, run python3 figure_2.py. Requirements: numpy, matplotlib. Running time is about a minute on CPU due to the fine discretization of sphere.

* To generate Fig. 3-4, use attached notebook and environment.

* To generate Fig. 5, run python3 figure_5.py with helperfunctions.py in the same directory. Requirements: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, and for MNIST dataset, tensorflow.keras.datasets. Running time: about 10 seconds on CPU
